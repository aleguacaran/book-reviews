## Rules
- Use slim syntax for views
- Use english language in views
- Follow good practices based on slim-lint defaults
- Use bootstrap 5.3 for styling and create components
- When creating styles, use a file for each module like book.sass or table.sass in case of common components
- For JS components, use a similiar behavior, using a file for a module like book.js or table.js in case of common components
