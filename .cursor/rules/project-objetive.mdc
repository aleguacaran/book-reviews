Using Test-Driven Development (TDD), implement a book review rating system with the following requirements:

## Requirements:
- A book review must have a rating of 1 to 5 stars
- Reviews can contain text
- The system must calculate the average rating for a book
- The average rating is expressed to the nearest tenth (rounding is required)
- Books with fewer than 3 reviews must be marked as "Insufficient Reviews"
- Reviews from banned users must not count toward the average
- A review cannot have more than 1000 characters

## Instructions:
1. Use RSpec to write the tests first
2. Implement the minimum code necessary for the tests to pass
3. Refactor while keeping the tests in the green
4. Follow Ruby/Rails best practices
